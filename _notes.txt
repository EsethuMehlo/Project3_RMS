NOTES
=====


TODO 
----
- add employee table
* Employee(id (PK, auto), name, surname, role?, start_date, phone_num, email_address? address?, salary?)
- once employee is added, display a message saying that the new employee/ order/ reservation was saved successfully

- add a credits page? or add this info in a metadata.json file?
- (maybe) remove register page, because only the manager/super-user can add new employees to the system
- rename 'screenshots' dir to 'media', add the ERD and class-diagram there eventually for the readme file 
- add secure login; cant allow users to access pages without access, spring security, youtube, chatgpt
-  

- add menu, and menu items, and categories (UI and table)
- redesign the sign in page
- create a seperate controller for each entity, example EmployeeController, etc..

- inject final version of ERD to readme file?
- add a 'cancel' / 'go back' button when creating a reservation or employee, and a js confirmation box
- create a .jar file for the production version
- create a project/version_download in github once the project is complete so people can download the zipped code 

- create a video-demo of the app once the alpha/beta version is complete, add the video to 
github, or to google drive and then add the link to github, and then interview a restaurant owner/manager (prepare questions)
about their management system(s)
(get a client)

- manager pages - employees, order, tables 
- kitchen-staff pages - orders 
- normalise the colors 
- reservation for a max of 2/3 hours per table 

- put profile info in the form of a table? 
- use js to inject the sidebar for all pages? 
- remove the div for plugins in all pages? 
- make the side bar un-scrollable most of the time
- open certain pages in a new tab or window
(employee-pay, employee-list, orders-only?)

- later, add images of the employee to the employee list, and menu list?
